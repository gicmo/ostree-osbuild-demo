# osbuild and ostree integration demo

This repository is demonstrating how [osbuild][osbuild] can be used
to create [ostree][ostree] commits and then in turn images based on
that commit.
NB: It uses not yet released osbuild code (see [PR#282][pr282])

# installation
Clone the [repository][this] and its git sub-module with:

```
git clone --recurisve
```

The dependencies to run it are:
  - ostree
  - rpm
  - systemd-container


# usage
Build the `ostree` commit and the image via:
```
sudo ./osbuild-ostree build
```

Boot the final image with:
```
./osbuild-ostree boot
```

Cleanup the build directory with:
```
./osbuild-ostree cleanup
```

## updates
Testing of updates can be done with the help of
`osbuild-update`. First of all, the a general
setup step will prepare a repository that will
contain the target commits in a format that can
be served via http. This is done via:

```
./osbuild-update setup
```
This will also ensure the image manifest has a
remote manually configured that points to the
host. This image needs to now be build by running:

```
./osbuild-ostree build
```

This will build the image with the starting commit
that will be updated later. After the build is done
import it into the main repository with:

```bash
./osbuild-update import
```

Now changes can be made to the package selection or
packages be updated.
After this a new commit needs to be build with these
changes but also with the starting commit as the
parent commit. This can be done via:

```
sudo ./osbuild-ostree build --commit --sign
```

NB: only the commit is being built, NOT the image,
because otherwise the image would be up-to-date,
and could not be updated.

After the new commit is built, it needs to be
imported into the update repository with:

``` bash
./osbuild-update import
```

Now the contents of the update repository can be
served via:

``` bash
./osbuild-update serve
```

What is left is to boot the image `sudo ./osbuild-ostree boot`,
log in (default: `root` with password `r`) and execute the
update: `rpm-ostree update`. Reboot, et voil√†, an updated image.

## Example output:
With the actual output of osbuild itself stripped,
this should give you something along the lines of:
